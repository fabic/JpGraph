## ChangeLog

* **2015-08-07 : initial work on this personal fork.**
  https://github.com/fabic/JpGraph/commit/49ac35fcfec3d9ba850cec052c6c2503bbc1c910
  Did review and merge all those forks out there, essentially trying to come up with
  that same "official stable v3.5.0b1" but with some few more pulses :
  **Beware** that I did this w/o testing anything, just reviewing patches as I was
  pulling in forked branches.
