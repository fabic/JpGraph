JpGraph from http://jpgraph.net/
======
This is a port for Symfony2 to put JpGraph as a Vendor library,
by https://github.com/ztec/JpGraph and forked here by https://github.com/fabic
for pulling in forks and eventual fixes.

Use `JpGraph\JpGraph::load();` and `JpGraph\JpGraph::module('moduleName');` to load required modules.

See fork notes at [README-fabic.md](https://github.com/fabic/JpGraph/blob/master/README-fabic.md)
