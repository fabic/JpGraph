JpGraph from http://jpgraph.net/
======

This is a port for Symfony2 to put JpGraph as a Vendor library,
by https://github.com/ztec/JpGraph and forked here by https://github.com/fabic
for pulling in forks and eventual fixes.

Use `JpGraph\JpGraph::load();` and `JpGraph\JpGraph::module('moduleName');` to load required modules.

* __*See fork notes at [README-fabic.md](https://github.com/fabic/JpGraph/blob/master/README-fabic.md)*__
* Did submit this to packagist.org as `fabic/jpgraph` (even though this is _yet another fork_, for I may maintain this for about one year) :
  https://packagist.org/packages/fabic/jpgraph
* The original _Ztec's_ package is `jpgraph/jpgraph`
  at https://packagist.org/packages/jpgraph/jpgraph
* `refs/tags/v3.5.0b1` references a tree that shall be the exact version of source
  from the official tarball (hence before everyone played with it).
